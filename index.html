        <h1 class="heading"> Dogs</h1> 
        
        <p>The dog is one of the most popular animals in the world. 
            It was one of the first animals to be domesticated, or trained for use by humans.
            The dog’s scientific name is Canis familiaris. 
            It is related to the coyote, wolves, foxes, and jackals.

            People around the world keep dogs as pets, guards, or work animals. Some dogs, called feral dogs, do not live with people. These homeless dogs often 
            roam around in groups, called packs. One type of dog, called the dingo, lives in the wild in Australia.
            The dog is a mammal with sharp teeth, an excellent sense of smell, and a fine sense of hearing. Each of its four legs ends in a foot, or paw, with five toes. Each toe has a soft pad and a claw. 
            A coat of hair keeps the dog warm. It cools off by panting and hanging its tongue out of its mouth.
